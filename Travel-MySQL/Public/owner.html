            <h3>Owner/Teacher</h3>
            <p>Nobu was born and raised in Japan. After earning a college degree in English language in Nagasaki, she attended the University of San Diego to obtain a BA in piano performance. In October 2002, Nobu moved to Hawaii to begin teaching piano at Piano Outlet, simultaneously earning a M.Ed at Chaminade University of Honolulu. When Piano Outlet closed in March 2011, Nobu opened her very own studio in Pearl City. Some of her passions include classical music, musical theater, ballet, impressionism art, baking, and traveling. In 2012, Nobu recorded a commemorative CD of 12 classical piano pieces by her favorite composers.</p>
