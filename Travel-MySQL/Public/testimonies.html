			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>It took me a few months after leaving Hawaii to reflect on how greatly my years of piano lessons with you has affected me.  I have taken only one music course this semester, Music Theory and Musicianship, because I have been so set on becoming an Engineering Major. After a year of college and not being able to go to the piano rooms so often, I am considering becoming a Music Major. It isn't official yet, but that's most likely what I will end up doing at Whittier College. Music is something I truly love and I know I will be happy with a career in music, no matter what I may be doing with that degree.  Thank you for everything you've taught me throughout the years. </p>

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>I started taking lessons from Nobu Sakurai Piano Studios after two years of haphazard self-teaching.  In my first month of lessons, I had learned more from them than I had in two years.  Elated by this progress, I switched into private lessons for more instructional time.  All of the instructors are excellent teachers and wonderful people, and under them I have been steadily progressing as a musician, even as I drift towards composing and music theory as an outlet towards my creativity.  Everyone has the potential to be a musician, and Nobu Sakurai Piano Studios is where I developed mine.  </p>

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>My daughter started piano at age 5 with Nobu at the former piano store at Pearl Highlands over 3 years ago.  We were devastated to hear the store was closing until Nobu told me she was opening her own studio.  My daughter loves taking lessons with Nobu - a huge plus to keep her motivated to both practice and to want to go to her lessons each week.  Nobu is great with kids and is also excited to see her students when they arrive.  I would be hard pressed to find another teacher who my daughter would love so much... I recommend her wholeheartedly.</p>

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>Mrs. Nobu has been a blessing to us! My son has been taking 1:1 piano lessons from her since late 2011.  Her talent and passion for music not only inspires my son to learn, it motivates him to be a better student! She pushes him to his potential, and is also always generous and timely with her compliments and acknowledgement of his accomplishments, big or small! As a parent, I love that about a teacher! And her style of teaching is reflected on the smile on my son's face after every lesson...<br />

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>Ms. Nobu is a very good piano teacher. When my daughter’s previous teacher had moved away, I was having a hard time to find a new teacher for my daughter. However, Ms. Nobu gently understood the way my daughter used to learn piano, and then she took my daughter’s unfinished lesson books and continued to the end. My daughter could make transition very easily to Ms. Nobu. My daughter loves to see Ms. Nobu for lessons every Thursday and enjoys piano more than before. I am very thankful to Ms. Nobu.<br />

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>I really like my class because Ms. Nobu is very friendly and she really knows the way to make you learn the piece you are working on. I also play violin and have joined the school orchestra. Because I play piano, it makes it so much easier to read notes and play violin.<br />
My brother is also in the same class and we have been taking piano lessons together for 6 years now. We both enjoy Ms. Nobu’s class so much!</p>

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>With my husband’s support, I was able to take private piano lessons for 3 years with Nobu at Piano Outlet. However, I stopped due to busy schedule at work and at home. Learning for me is never ending; age does not matter. Luckily, I was able to find Nobu’s studio again and once more, I am learning to play piano and enjoying every moment I touch the keyboard producing lovely sound of music. I give my thanks to my family for their support and to Nobu and Jensen – they are GREAT teachers with lots of love and patience to their students. </p>

			<div class="testimonial"><div class="testimony"><p>My two children started taking piano lessons at another studio when they were 4 and 5 years old. Their previous instructor was very impatient and at times rude. After about 8 months, I decided to give another piano studio a try. That was when I found Nobu Sakurai Piano Studios. Her patience and positive attitude made my children feel very welcoming and at ease. My children have been taking lessons from Mrs. Nobu for over a year now and I have seen tremendous progress in their music.</p>
